This weather app project using Python (Flask) and OpenWeatherMap API is a great beginner-level web development exercise that teaches you how to:

ðŸ”¹ Frontend + Backend Integration
Flask acts as the backend server, handling user requests and fetching weather data.

HTML & CSS build the frontend interface that the user interacts with.

Using Jinja2 templating, the Python code sends data to the HTML page dynamically.

ðŸ”¹ Working of the App (Summary):
User enters a city name in the input box and submits.

Flask receives the request, fetches live weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API using the requests module.

Weather data (temperature, humidity, wind, etc.) is passed to the web page (index.html) using render_template().

The page displays:

Current weather

A static 5-day forecast (dummy data used in this example)

The app uses simple and clean CSS styling to present the results in a user-friendly way.

ðŸ”¹ What You Learn from This Code:
How to create a Flask web application

How to use HTML forms to take input from users

How to call external APIs and use requests in Python

How to pass data from Python to HTML using Jinja2 templates

How to organize your project into app.py, templates/, and static/

ðŸ”š Final Words
This project is a complete full-stack mini weather app, combining Python backend logic, API integration, and frontend design. It is a solid starting point for learning how web apps work, and you can easily extend it by adding:

Real 5-day forecast

Icons (sunny, cloudy, etc.)

Recent searches or local storage

Temperature units switch (Â°F â†” Â°C)
